            <p class="section2 small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Formal education is commonly
                divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and
                then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.In most regions,
                education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                for evidence-based education</p>

            <p class="section2 small">Unity in diversity' is used as an expression of harmony and unity between
                dissimilar individuals or groups. It is a concept of "unity without uniformity and diversity without
                fragmentation"[1] that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural,
                linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or psychological differences towards a more
                complex unity based on an understanding that difference enriches human interactions. The idea and
                related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World
                cultures. It has applications in many fields, including ecology, cosmology, philosophy,
                religion and politics.</p>
